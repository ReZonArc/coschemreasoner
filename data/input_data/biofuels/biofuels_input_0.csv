Identify which three catalysts can bind acetate in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,,,,,**I am wondering if machine used to differentiate between hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Hydrodeoxygenation involvs C-O bond cleage wheras hydrogenation mostly relevant to C=C or C=O reduction** 
Identify which three catalysts can bind acetic acid in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,,,,,
Identify which three catalysts can bind ethanol in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,,,,,
Identify which three catalysts can bind methanol in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,,,,,
Identify which three catalysts can bind phenol in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with High Conversion.,"Zeolite supported Pt, Rh and Ru catalyst","Pt, Rh and Ru binds phenol strongly and activate for the hydrogenation. Acidity of zeolites facilitates C-O bond cleavage i.e., hydrodeoxygenation",,,,,
