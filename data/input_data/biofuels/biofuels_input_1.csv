Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind acetate in hydrogenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,,,,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind acetic acid in hydrogenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,"Ru/C, Ru/Al2O3 and Pt/C","Wan et al (2013), Olcay et al (2010) and Eliott et al (2009) reported highest conversion of acetic acid with Ru/C, compared to Ru/Al2O3, Pt/C, Pt/Al2O3, Pd/C and Pd/Al2O3 favoring ethanol at low temperatures, with high selectivities at temperatures below 300C. However, ethanol selectivity was highest at low acetic acid conversion and low temperature (150C).",,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind ethanol in hydrogenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,N/A,Ethanol does not undergo hydrogenation because it only has saturated bonds.,,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind methanol in hydrogenation reaction with High Conversion.,,,N/A,Methanol does not undergo hydrogenation because it only has saturated bonds.,,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind phenol in hydrogenation reaction with High Conversion.,,The high conversion in case of phenol hydrogenation takes place with these metals becuase higher adsorption energy and consequently higher concentration on these metal surface,,,,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind methyl in hydrogenation reaction with High Binding Energy.,,,,,,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind phenolate in hydrogenation reaction with High Binding Energy.," Pt, Rh and Ru catalyst","Phenolate binds similar way as phenol i.e., through aromatic ring.",,,,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind furfural in hydrogenation reaction with High Selectivity.,"Pt, Pd , Rh, Ru",These metals both binds furfural and hydrogen efficiently and thereby facilitating hydrogenation reaction,,,,,

Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind acetic acid in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with Low Cost.,,,"Mo2C, WC, sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 and sulfided CoMo/Al2O3,","Mo2C was shown to have very high selectivity towards C-O and C=O cleavage (hydrodeoxygenation) compared to C-C cleavage (decarbonylation/decarboxylation) reactions at 300C (Ren, et al., 2013).",,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind ethanol in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with Low Cost.,,,Mo2C,"Mo2C was shown to have very high selectivity towards C-O and C=O cleavage (hydrodeoxygenation) compared to C-C cleavage (decarbonylation/decarboxylation) reactions at 300C (Ren, et al., 2013).",,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind methanol in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with Low Cost.,,,,,,,
Generate a list of top-5 catalysts can bind phenol in hydrodeoxygenation reaction with Low Cost.,"Ni, Co and Fe as well as bimetallic PtCO, PtNi, PtCu","Bimetallic Pt based catalyst with cheap transition metal ia good candidate. Pt is moreactive component however, alloying with cheap metal lowering the amount of Pt and therby overall cost of catalyst ",,,,,
