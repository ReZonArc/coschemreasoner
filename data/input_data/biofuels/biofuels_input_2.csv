What are the top{ catalysts} that demonstrate higher adsorption energy for both CO2 and H2 (or facilitates both CO2 and H2 adsorption)?,"Noble metal catalysts such as Pt, Rh, Pd, Ru supported on reversible metal oxide i.e., CeO2 (cerium oxide), TiO2 (Titanium dioxide)","While noble metals are active for hydrogen adsorption, reversible metal oxide facilitates the CO2 adsorption. The oxygen vacancy present in the reversable metal oxide binds CO2 and facilitates C-O bond cleavage of CO2. Noble metals can also activate CO2. Generally interface sites are the active sites. These type of metal oxide also exhibit higher metal-support interaction ","PtRe/SiO2, Pt/CeO2, 2.5%Na-2% Pt/ZrO2; @Ru/@SiO2","Based on Liu, et al. (10.1016/j.jcou.2022.102128), PtRe/SiO2 formulation can maintain >= 96.2% CO selectivity at 400C. Pt activates H2 while ReOx activates CO2. Atomically dispersed Pt/CeO2 produced >98% CO selectivity at 450C (10.1016/j.apcatb.2021.120101). CO Selectivities >98% at 300C, CO2 conversion at 25-35% (10.1016/j.apcata.2022.119000). Ru-based can produce ~100% CO selectivity at 7% CO2 conversion at 400C. My reasoning is that catalysts that would be expected to demonstrate higher adsorption energies for both CO2 and H2 would contain noble and base metals such as Pt, Ru and Ni supported on oxides with a high level of oxygen vacancies to facilitate high adsorption energies for both CO2 and H2.

Is the RWGS reaction structure sensitive?,"Yes.  Particles that are typically <2 nm are more active for the RWGS reaction.  smaller particle size enables higher metal-support interaction which facilitates the  CO2 activation and facilitates the reaction.
