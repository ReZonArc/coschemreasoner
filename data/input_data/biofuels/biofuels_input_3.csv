What are the crystal planes that are most active for the adsorption of CO2 for noble metal catalysts?,Open structure such as (100) or (110) planes of metal catalyst are more active towards CO2 activation.,Binding energy of CO2 with these planes are high ,,,How many answers can there be? May require diferent parser for answers. Needs a different Policy. How to validate adsorption? Choose a catalyst?,,
What are the crystal planes that are most active for the adsorption of H2 for noble metal catalysts?,(111) planes are more active towards H2 activation.,Binding energy of H2 with (111) planes are high,,,^,,
What are the crystal planes that demonstrate weaker adsorption of CO for noble metal catalysts?,(110) planes. ,"In general step and kink sites i.e., co-ordinatevely unsaturated sites exhibitweaker CO binding energy",,,^,,
What are the top{ bimetallic catalysts} that demonstrate higher adsorption energy for both CO2 and H2 (or facilitates both CO2 and H2 adsorption)?,"PtCo, PtNi, PdNi",,,,,,
Identify the top{ bimetallic catalysts} that exhibit weak adsorption energy for CO.,"PtCo, PdZn, PdAg, ",Electronics of bimetallics resulted in weaker CO binding energy,,,,,
What are the top{ bimetallic catalysts} that contain cheap metals are most active for RWGS reaction?,"PtCo, NiCu supported on metal oxide ","Cheap, more active and more selective due to weaker CO binding energy",,,,,
What are the top{ metal oxide catalysts} that demonstrate higher adsorption energy for both CO2 and H2 (or facilitates both CO2 and H2 adsorption)?,"CeO2, TiO2",Reversible metal oxide binds CO2 effectively due to the oxygen vacancy. ,,,,,
Identify [cheap]{ bulk metal catalysts} that are most active for RWGS.,"Ag, Zn ",Although most of the noble metals activates CO2 they are not very selective to CO due to overhydrogenation to form methane (CH4). Ag is one of the catalyst on which CO binds weakly,,,,,
